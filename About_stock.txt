Machine learning for stock market is like "Digital Advisor".

Every system should follow
1. Data Ingestion: Gathering the raw "raw materials" (Price & Volume, etc).
2. Feature Engineering: Refining raw data into "indicators" that show trends or momentum (The "Why" for the model).
3. Model Training (eg, Random Forest): Teaching the model by showing it historical patterns and the results that followed.
4. Signal Evaluation: Testing the model on new data to see if its "Buy" signals actually lead to profit.

Machine learning models cannot "see" a chart. They only see numbers. 
Feature Engineering is the act of creating numbers that represent market concepts.


Alpha Factors
1. Price & Momentum (The "What is happening now?" features)
These are calculated directly from price data and are the most common starting point.
Trend - SMA (10, 50, 200), EMA, MACD - Helps the model identify the "path of least resistance."
Momentum - RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, ROC - Identifies if the move is "strong" or "exhausted."
Returns - Daily Log Returns, Weekly Returns - Measures the velocity of price changes.
Volatility - Bollinger Bands, ATR, Std Dev - Tells the model if the market is "calm" or "panicking."

2. Volume & Liquidity (The "Is this move real?" features)
Price moving up is great, but price moving up on high volume is a much stronger signal.
OBV (On-Balance Volume): High OBV confirms a trend; a falling OBV during a price rise suggests a "fake" move.
Chaikin Money Flow: Measures if the big players are accumulating (buying) or distributing (selling).
Volume Z-Score: Measures how today's volume compares to the average. (1.0 = normal, 3.0 = extreme interest).

3. Time-Series & Statistical Features (The "Technical" features)
These help the model understand the structure of time.
Lag Features: Providing the price from 1, 3, and 5 days ago as separate inputs so the model can see the "shape" of the past week.
Day of Week: Some stocks behave differently on Mondays (market opening) vs. Fridays (profit-taking).
Distance from Mean: The percentage difference between the Current Price and the 200-day Moving Average (shows if a stock is "extended").

4. Alternative & External Data (The "Advanced" features)
Once you master the basics, you add "Context" from outside the stock itself.
Sentiment Score: A number from -1 to +1 derived from news headlines (using NLP).
Market Correlation: How the S&P 500 (SPY) is performing compared to your specific stock.
Interest Rates/VIX: General market "fear" (VIX) or economic health indicators.


How to tackle any business problem
Objective: "Refined a vague business question into a supervised learning task."
Action: "Identified key features and trained a [Model Name] to identify patterns."
Result: "Provided an evaluation metric that directly relates to [Revenue/Risk/Time saved]."



Prerequisites for markets

1. Mathematical Prerequisites
1.1 Algebra - 
We will deal with the matrices more often
Basic matric operations - Addition, multication, subtraction, Transpose


2.Statistics Prerequisites
Mean - sum of all values divided by the number of values.
Variance - measure of the dispersion of values in a sample.
Standard deviation - squared root of the variance. We used to calculate volatility of an asset.
Cumulative sum - cumulative sum is a sequence of partial sums of a given sequence.
Cumulative product - Product of all values in sequenceMean squared error (MSE)
Mean squared error (MSE)
Mean absolute error (MAE)

Statistical tests - augmented Dick and Fuller test
In any statistical test, we have only two possibilities - we reject H0, or we cannot reject H0.
We use p-value to check which possibility to select
• p > s: we can’t reject H0
• p < s : we can reject H0

probability laws
There are 2 essential functions in probability
1. Cumulative distribution function or repartition function - probability that the random variable X is below the value x. 
2. Probability density function (PDF) - to understand the distributions of observations.

Optimization - 
optimization methods allow us to minimize or maximize a function under constraints.

Prerequisites in finance
1. Market efficiency -  
different levels of efficiency
Weak market efficiency
Semi-strong market efficiency
Strong market efficiency

Basics of trading
CFD (Contract for Differences).
shorting an asset
spread - difference between the bid price and the asking price.
leverage
Stop Loss

Basics of portfolio management - goal of portfolio management is to invest using technic to reduce
the portfolio’s risk
meanvariance portfolio theory

Prerequisites in Python

Libraries for data science
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

Libraries for finance
1. Yfinance
2. Datetime
3. Time

Libraries for mathematics
1. Scipy

Portfolio management, risk management and backtesting
1. Static Portfolio management
Why behind portfolio optimization methods - 
There are two types of risks - Systematic risk and specific risk
Asset-specific risk is the risk associated with an asset that does not
depend on market conditions.
systemic risk is a macroeconomic risk on all the economy's
assets

objective of the portfolio optimization methods is to reduce the
specific risk in the portfolio. For that we use diversification

diversification - to increase the number of assets in the portfolio to
make the specific risk of each asset insignificant.
