Machine learning for stock market is like "Digital Advisor".

Every system should follow
1. Data Ingestion: Gathering the raw "raw materials" (Price & Volume, etc).
2. Feature Engineering: Refining raw data into "indicators" that show trends or momentum (The "Why" for the model).
3. Model Training (eg, Random Forest): Teaching the model by showing it historical patterns and the results that followed.
4. Signal Evaluation: Testing the model on new data to see if its "Buy" signals actually lead to profit.

Machine learning models cannot "see" a chart. They only see numbers. 
Feature Engineering is the act of creating numbers that represent market concepts.

Features - 
1. Returns: This tells the model the "speed" of the price change.
2. SMA (Simple Moving Average): This smooths out daily "noise" to show the Trend. If Price > SMA, the trend is up. If Price < SMA, the trend is down.
